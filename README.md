# Fourier_Transforms_Image_Processing
This is an assignment for CMPE 457. The purpose of this assignment was to practically apply our knowledge of Fourier Transforms to perform convolutions and remove noise for images. This was achieved by implementing the math behind Fourier Transformations and applying them with filters to the images.
